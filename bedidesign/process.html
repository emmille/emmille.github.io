                <h1>Consultation</h1>
                <p>Getting the custom made bridal gown of your dreams begins with your private consultation with the designers. We truly believe that each bride is unique and deserves an exquisite gown that is tailored to enhance her beauty and be as stunning as she is. During the consultation, we will discuss the different options that will fit your desires and budget. If additional dresses will be made for any members of your party, we can discuss your wishes for those dresses as well during this time.</p>
                <h1>Design</h1>
                <p>After your consultation, you can relax knowing that your designers are working through the details of your order. Vendors for the textiles and materials needed for your gown are being sourced from India to be shipped directly to the designers, giving you the best value for your budget.</p>
                <h1>Client Approval</h1>
                <p>The designers will contact you once their design work is complete and materials obtained to confirm the final details of your gown. This is your chance to make any adjustments to the design discussed in the consultation. No wedding happens without a change in plans here and there! At this time, the estimated cost of your gown will be updated to reflect any change in design or in the sourcing and purchase of your authentic textiles.</p>
                <h1>Fitting</h1>
                <p>Once the designers have hand sewn the last bead and pressed out every wrinkle, you will have the chance to try on your gown to ensure proper fit. The designers will work to make any alternations needed to make your gown fit you perfectly. Once complete, your dress will be ready for your big day!</p>
